Quick Notes For Github :

1) Add name and email of the user to track changes
	git config --global user.name "Your name"
	git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

2) Repositories : A container for a project that is tracked by Git.
		  These are of two types are : 
						*local:stored locally for personal local use.
						*remote:stored remotely for teams collab.

3) Initialize a git repo : Creates new repo for the project. Navigate to the project folder and type :
			   git init

4) Check Git status : Checks git repository status of changed/modification files, tracked files, untracked files : 
			   git status

5) Staging files : Adds files to staging area so that files can be tracked for changes :
			   git add filename.extension filename.extension

6) Making commits : Commit makes saving a snapshot of file data at a particular time in commit history so that we can roll back
		    to past file data if we want. Before commiting, file must be staged.
			   git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"
			   
7) Downloading repositories from github : Download/clone and work seamlessly from a project repo
   from the current state into local computer.
   					  git pull <https github repo link>
   					  
) Creating branch : to create branch use -b flag.
		    git checkout -b branch-name
